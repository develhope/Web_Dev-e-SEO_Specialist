In this exercise you will refactor your SASS code to use BEM methodology.

**Suggestions:**

- Use the `&` selector to avoid repeating the parent selector.
- Use the **block** syntax for components.
- Use the **block__element** syntax for elements inside a component.
- Use the **block__element--modifier** syntax for modifiers of a component.
- The navbar should be a component.
- The navbar links should be elements of the navbar component.
- The navbar links should have a modifier to change the color when the link is active.
- The title, description, image, button, technologies and projects should be components.
